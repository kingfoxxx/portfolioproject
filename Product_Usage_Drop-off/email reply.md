Subject: Analysis of Product Usage Drop-Off in January 2023

Hi Casey,

Thanks for flagging this Cassey. I’ve taken a deep dive into the data to analyze the significant drop in product usage for the customer during January 2023. Here are my findings:

Total Usage:

The total time spent across all features for this customer was under 50 hours (~3,000 minutes) in January 2023, well below their previous monthly averages.

Data Breakdown:

The most-used features in January were:

Roadmap: 716 minutes

Saga Creation: 670 minutes

Reporting: 605 minutes

Task Creation: 568 minutes

This distribution suggests the customer’s engagement primarily focused on planning and reporting tasks.

Daily Usage Patterns:

Average daily usage was: 101 minutes

Maximum daily usage was: 137 minutes

Minimum daily usage was: 55 minutes

The daily usage consistency appears low compared to prior months, which may indicate a behavior shift and change.

Trend Analysis:

A clear drop in usage is visible in January 2023 when compared to historical data. This could point to external factors, or changes in user behavior.

My Recommendation:

1. My recommendation is to engage the Customer by reaching out to understand if there were any external changes (e.g., health challenges, business priorities) or issues with the platform that may have caused the drop.

2. Check for any system updates, downtimes, or feature changes in late 2022 or early 2023 that might have impacted usage.

3. Set up alerts for significant changes in usage patterns for key customers to address concerns in the future.

I’ve attached a visualization of the monthly usage trends over the past few years, highlighting the steep decline in January 2023.

Let me know if further analysis is needed or if you’d like me to assist in the follow-up with the customer.

Best regards, Bright Rikin
