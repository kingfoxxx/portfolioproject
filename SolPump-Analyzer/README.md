Solana Memecoin Trading Bot (SolPump-Analyzer)

A high-frequency, data-driven trading bot for Solana memecoins using real-time market and social data.

Overview
This project is an automated trading bot designed to identify and trade trending Solana memecoins with high pump potential within 24-48 hours. Built in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment, it integrates real-time data scraping, social sentiment analysis, and blockchain transaction execution to maximize short-term returns. The bot leverages APIs from Dexscreener, TweetScout, and Rugcheck, alongside Solana’s blockchain via the solders library, to execute trades on Raydium.

Features
Real-Time Data Scraping: Pulls memecoin volume, liquidity, and price data from Dexscreener.
Social Sentiment Analysis: Assesses X audience quality via TweetScout to gauge community hype.
Risk Validation: Uses Rugcheck to filter out high-risk tokens based on holder distribution and scam potential.
Automated Trading: Executes buy/sell orders on Raydium with slippage and priority fee controls.
Profit Monitoring: Implements a take-profit (20%) and stop-loss (10%) mechanism.

Tech Stack
Programming: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Data Scraping: requests, BeautifulSoup
Blockchain: solana-py, solders (Solana RPC integration)
Libraries: json, re, collections, datetime, time, base58
Cloud Potential: Designed for future GCP integration (BigQuery, Cloud Functions)

Install Dependencies:
bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 solana solders base58
Set Up Wallet: Replace WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY in Cell 2 with a test key (e.g., 2xYkPqWnRjT5vF8mB9cD3eHgK7uN4tQ6wA1sZ2vX9pJ8rM5nL3kP7tQ9wE4uB6yV8zC1xF2gH3jK5mN7rT9vY1bD)—use a real key only after securing funds.
Run: Open bot.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and execute cells sequentially.
Usage
Cell 1: Installs dependencies.
Cell 2: Configures RPC and wallet (fake key for testing).
Cell 3: Fetches and ranks trending memecoins (e.g., WIF, BOME).
Cell 4: Analyzes X audience quality (optional).
Cell 5: Validates token safety with Rugcheck.
Cell 6: Executes trades on Raydium—requires token accounts.
Cell 7: Runs the full trading cycle.
Example
python
# Cell 7 snippet
top_memecoins = rank_memecoins()
for coin in top_memecoins:
    print(f"Evaluating {coin['name']}")
    buy_tx = buy_token(coin["pair_address"], coin["contract_address"], 0.1)
    if buy_tx:
        monitor_and_take_profit(coin["pair_address"], coin["contract_address"], buy_price)
Future Enhancements
Integrate GCP for real-time data storage (BigQuery) and serverless execution (Cloud Functions).
Enhance social scoring with X API sentiment analysis.
Add multi-token account management for live trading.
